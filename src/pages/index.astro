      About me
    </h1>
    <div class="text-lg gap-6 flex flex-col lg:pl-24 lg:pr-24">
      <p>
        My name is Victor Hugo Buntrok, but my friends usually call me just
        Hugo. Currently a Network Administrator and a soon to be Computer
        Engineer with a passion for programming. I'm a quick learner and I'm
        always striving to be the best. I'm a dedicated problem-solver, and I
        thrive on finding innovative solutions to real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a bunch of hobbies - maybe too many, but I like to keep myself
        busy. When I'm not programming, I'm an avid audiophile, cinephile, and
        love playing games. I also enjoy tinkering with custom keyboards and
        building budget servers out of old computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually solve problems by myself, but I am also a very good team
        player. I'm determined to excel and bring out the best in myself and
        those around me. I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to any
        web development team.
