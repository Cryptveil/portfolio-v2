# Portfolio v2

This will be my updated portfolio. I was going to design it in Figma but I'm kinda letting it flow for now. It's feeling very empty but I will figure something out when I finish the basics.

It's almost done but I'm not feeling the overall themeing, might change colors and/or styles.
